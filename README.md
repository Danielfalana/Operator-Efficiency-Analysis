> **Power BI dashboard** designed to monitor and compare operator efficiency, downtime, and productivity using **SQL Server** and **Excel** data sources.  
> Combines advanced **data modeling**, **ETL automation**, and **interactive visual analytics** to empower managers with actionable insights for operational improvement.

## üß† Introduction  
The **Operator Efficiency Dashboard** was developed to analyze operator performance across key production metrics such as downtime, efficiency rate, and work time.  
Its goal is to provide real-time insights that help management optimize workforce productivity, identify bottlenecks, and improve overall operational efficiency.

---

## üö® Problem Statement  
The production team lacked real-time visibility into operator performance.  
Manual reporting processes were time-consuming and prone to errors, making it difficult to evaluate efficiency and compare operators effectively.  
A centralized, interactive dashboard was required to automate performance tracking and enhance decision-making.

---

## üß© Skills Demonstrated  
- **Data Cleaning & Transformation** using Power Query and SQL  
- **Data Modeling** with Star Schema and DAX measures  
- **Interactive Visualization** in Power BI  
- **KPI Development** (Efficiency %, Downtime %, Performance Ratio)  
- **Analytical Insight Generation** and performance trend analysis  

---

## üóÇÔ∏è Data Source  
- Operator activity and performance logs extracted from **Microsoft SQL Server**  
- Supplementary datasets from **Excel/CSV files** (shift schedules, operator info)  

---

## üîÑ Data Transformation  
- Cleaned and standardized data using **Power Query**  
- Removed null values and corrected data types for consistency  
- Calculated key fields including:  
  - `Actual Work Time`  
  - `Minimum Required Time`  
  - `Downtime %`  
- Combined multiple data sources into a unified fact table for efficiency reporting  

---

## üß± Data Modeling  
Implemented a **Star Schema** design for optimized querying and analysis:  

**Fact Table:**  
- `FactOperatorPerformance` ‚Äî containing work time, downtime, and efficiency data  

**Dimension Tables:**  
- `DimOperator`, `DimDate`, `DimShift`  

**Key DAX Measures:**  
- **Efficiency Rate** = DIVIDE([Minimum Time], [Actual Time]) * 100  
  *Measures how efficiently operators complete tasks relative to the expected time.*

- **Performance Ratio** = DIVIDE([Actual Time], [Minimum Time])  
  *Indicates how actual work time compares to the target time; lower ratios represent higher efficiency.*

- **Downtime %** = DIVIDE([Downtime], [Total Work Time]) * 100  
  *Shows the percentage of total time lost due to operational or system issues.*

## üìä Analysis & Visualization  

The **Operator Efficiency Dashboard** provides an interactive and data-driven view of workforce performance, combining visual storytelling with quantitative analysis.  

### üîç Key Analytical Components  

**1. KPI Overview**  
- **Total Downtime (hrs):** Tracks the total hours lost to operator or system inefficiencies.  
- **Efficiency %:** Measures productivity by comparing actual vs. expected work time.  
- **Actual Work Time (hrs):** Summarizes the total productive time logged by operators.  

**2. Operator Comparison**  
- Displays individual **Efficiency Rate** and **Performance Ratio** for each operator.  
- Operators can be filtered (Charlie, Dee, Dennis, Mac) to analyze personal metrics.  
- Dynamic ranking cards visualize who performs best based on Efficiency %.  

**3. Trend and Correlation Analysis**  
- A combined **bar and line chart** shows *Actual vs. Minimum Work Time* with Efficiency % overlay.  
- **Downtime %** trend line highlights the relationship between lost hours and overall efficiency.  
- **Insight Tooltips** explain complex metrics such as the inverse relationship between Efficiency % and Performance Ratio.

üí° **Key Insight:**  
Higher **Efficiency %** corresponds to a lower **Performance Ratio**, meaning tasks are completed faster and more effectively.

## üß≠ Conclusion & Recommendations  

### ‚úÖ **Key Findings**  
- Operators **Charlie** and **Dennis** consistently showed higher efficiency and lower downtime.  
- Average **Efficiency Rate** improved to **~62%**, while **Total Downtime** dropped by **21%** compared to the previous measurement period.  
- A strong inverse relationship exists between **Efficiency %** and **Performance Ratio**, confirming that time optimization directly impacts productivity.

### üß© **Recommendations**  
- **Sustain high performance:** Continue reinforcing best practices among top-performing operators.  
- **Target improvement areas:** Provide coaching and workflow support for operators below the efficiency threshold.  
- **Automate reporting:** Schedule **Power BI data refreshes** for near real-time visibility.  
- **Expand analytics scope:** Incorporate machine-level efficiency data and production cost metrics for end-to-end operational analysis.  

üìà **Impact:**  
This dashboard transformed manual performance reporting into a self-service analytical tool, improving data accessibility and enabling management to make faster, evidence-based decisions.
